## Hobbies
I spend an unhealthy amount of my spare time binging television shows. My favorites are [Better Call Saul](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3032476/), [Succession](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660850/), [Doctor Who](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436992/), and [Monty Python's Flying Circus](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063929).
I'm a huge fan of [Bo Burnham](http://www.boburnham.com), and watch animation/anime occasionally, including [R&M](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424) and [AOT](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140)

I also spend my spare time playing two highly addictive games: [Rimworld](https://rimworldgame.com) and [Factorio](http://factorio.com)
, and [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/jettchen11), though I'm not very good at any of these.
